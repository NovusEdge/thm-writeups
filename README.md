### A side-note

To those people who rant about me putting flags and stuff in my writeups... _Fuck you :P_
But to clarify, I put the flags because I'm too lazy to censor them (yep, that's all). Also there's some machines like **Blue** that are quite annoying to crack simply because they're too case-specific i.e. they require you to use a very specific exploit that either has a chance to work or will not work for you even if you sell your soul.
